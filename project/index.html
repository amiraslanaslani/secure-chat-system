        <strong>How to Use Secure Chat:</strong>
        <ol style="margin:0.7rem 0 0 1.2rem;">
          <li>Click <b>Enter Chat</b> below to access the chat room.</li>
          <li>Choose a <b>channel name</b> and <b>set a password</b> to create or join a private channel.</li>
          <li>Share the channel name and password with your friends to chat together securely.</li>
          <li>All messages are encrypted <b>before</b> they leave your device. Only those with the correct password can read them.</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>About Client-Side Encryption:</strong>
        <ul style="margin:0.7rem 0 0 1.2rem;">
          <li>Messages are encrypted in your browser using your channel password <b>before</b> being sent to the server.</li>
          <li>Decryption happens only on your device. <b>No one else</b> (not even server admins) can read your messages without the password.</li>
          <li>Even if the server is compromised, your conversations remain private and secure.</li>
          <li>This ensures <b>zero-knowledge privacy</b>: only you and those you trust have access to your messages.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Project Motivation:</strong>
        <p style="margin:0.7rem 0 0 0;">
          This project is a personal experiment, developed by AI with a vibe coding approach, born from the need for an open-source, secure chat platform that truly embraces a zero-trust policy. With only one free week to dedicate, the goal was to create something simple and accessible‚Äîsomething anyone could deploy on a basic, affordable Linux shared host, which is why PHP was chosen. While it's not built to handle massive loads, it's a foundation for privacy-focused communication that can be improved with your help. If you have ideas or want to contribute, your input is very welcome!
